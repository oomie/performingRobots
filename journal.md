During Thursday's class this week, we started building our robot base.

We started by soldering and extending the wires for the two motors and then building the wheel to attach the motors to it. We used a hub to attach the motors to the wheels, and screwed everything in tight.

We then started mapping out how everything would attach to our wooden base. We measured out the center and lined up our wheels, with the motor-powered ones on either side and the regular wheels on the top and bottom of the base. After figuring out where everything would go and getting the metal brackets, Sara drilled the holes into the base. Our next step is going to be screwing everything into the base and securing any wires.

Linh's presentation on humanoid robots and theatre.

Question: 

Does the design of a robot, whether mechanical or humanoid, add anything to the story being told? Is a humanoid robot character in a play aware that is a robot, or does it act human?

I don't know if I would like the idea of a humanoid robot acting as a human and not a robot. I think it should be self aware.

Second presentation was by me.
