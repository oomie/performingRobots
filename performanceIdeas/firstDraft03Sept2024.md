# Performance idea
## Clue: NYUAD edition
One of the robots from the performing robots class has been destroyed just hours before the performance!! The remaining robots begin to accuse each other, but Who did it?

Characters: 
Mr black (the destroyed robot)

The suspects: Colonel Mustard, Reverend Green, Mrs. Scarlett, Miss Peacock, Dr. Orchid, and Professor Plum (we can change the characters, these are just the characters from the board game, each named after a color)

Short outline:
The robots are excitedly preparing for their debut stage performance! Just hours before showtime, the robots make a shocking discovery: Mr. Black, the lead in the play, is in dire condition: wires sticking out, pieces moving out of order, and barely conscious! Who could have done such a horrible thing?!
The robots begin to state their alibis and start to question and accuse each other. Chaos ensues and accusations are thrown left and right. 

The robots start to investigate the scene and find a few potential weapons that the culprit could have used. The robots piece together the clues and with the audience's help, they begin to uncover the mystery, with the evidence pointing to either Mrs Scarlett or Reverend Green. 

The audience votes for who did it (maybe with a show of hands?) and we could have two potential endings based on who they vote as the culprit. 


### Alternate idea:

### Scooby Doo Murder Mystery

Characters: Scooby, Velma, Daphne, Fred, Shaggy, and 2 potential villains. (Someone could even build the mystery machine as a set robot!)

The demasking of the villains can be fun - we can make a double-sided robot, possibly with a cape so the back isn't immediately visible before the reveal. For the plot, I think we could take inspiration from an existing episode - there are hundreds to choose from.
